        <li>
          <strong>Account Responsibility:</strong>
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users are responsible
          for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials,
          including usernames and passwords. Any activity conducted using a
          user‚Äôs account is considered the responsibility of the account holder,
          and the platform is not liable for any unauthorized access or misuse.

        <br />

        <li>
          <strong>Lawful Use Only:</strong>
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform must only
          be used for lawful purposes. Users agree to comply with all applicable
          local, state, national, and international laws and regulations. Any
          misuse, such as conducting illegal activities, uploading malicious
          data, or violating privacy laws, is prohibited and may result in

          <strong>Data Integrity:</strong>
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system provides
          data fusion capabilities but does not guarantee the accuracy or
          completeness of the results. Users should independently verify data
          outputs and conclusions drawn from the data fusion process, especially
          for critical decision-making or regulatory compliance.

          to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the platform or its
          services at any time without notice. While we aim to maintain service
          availability, disruptions may occur, and users agree not to hold the
          platform liable for any loss of service.

          from attempting to reverse-engineer, decompile, or otherwise tamper

          such attempt will result in immediate suspension or termination of the
          user‚Äôs account.

        <br />

        <li>
          <strong>Data Privacy and Compliance:</strong>

          for ensuring that any data they upload to the platform complies with
          data protection and privacy laws, including GDPR, CCPA, or other
          relevant legislation. Users must have appropriate consent for the data
          they submit, and the platform reserves the right to remove any data

          guarantee that the service will always be available without
          interruptions. Users acknowledge that occasional downtime for
          maintenance, upgrades, or unforeseen circumstances may occur.

          of the data they upload to the platform. However, by submitting data
          to the platform, users grant the platform a non-exclusive, worldwide
          license to process, store, and analyze the data as required for the
          operation of the service. This license can be revoked by deleting the
          data from the platform.

        <br />

        <li>
          <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong>
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection and use
          of personal data are governed by our Privacy Policy, which is separate
          from these terms and can be accessed at any time. We encourage users
          to read the Privacy Policy to understand how their personal data is
          managed.
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>
          <strong>Termination of Use:</strong>
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reserve the right

          violations of these Terms of Use. Users can terminate their accounts
          at any time by following the appropriate procedures within the

          remain in effect.
